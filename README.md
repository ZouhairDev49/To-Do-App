# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

3. **Save the file.**

Once you've written the content you want, save the `README.md` file.

4. **Commit and push the `README.md` file:**
   
   If the `README.md` file is new and not added to your Git repository, use the following commands to add and commit it:

   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add README.md file"
   git push origin main
